# NoPspEmuDrm

A plugin to bypass all PSPEmu DRM Checks,
so you can play digital PSP or PS1 game backups; or of course- games you legitimately own but on another PSN Account

Defintely do not use this for piracy that would be bad mmkay?

Okay, now that message to keep the lawyers happy is out of the way --

Features: 
- Play any PSP, PSX, NeoGeo, PC Engine or TurboGrafix16 contents without a license
- Use any PSP DLC Content (EDATs) without a license 
- Use PocketStation functionality with PSX games that support it. note: requires "PocketStation App" (ux0:/ps1emu/PCSC80018/texture.enc) to be present
